I am a Network Engineering graduate from Jimei University, currently serving in the Network Operations Department at China Unicom Fujian. My work focuses on maintaining network stability, optimizing system performance, and supporting the development of reliable telecommunication services. With a strong technical foundation and a commitment to continuous learning, I strive to contribute to the advancement of network operations and digital connectivity. If you wanna know more about me, you can visit my [GitHub pages](https://github.com/Mrwhy233).

University Life Experience
======
During my university years, I focused more on enjoying life than on being an exemplary student. I usually studied only right before exams — just enough to pass. I didn’t participate in competitions, and I took part-time jobs mostly for the experience rather than a career plan.

Life at university was pretty good — at least I didn’t have to think so far ahead like I do now.

Game Life
======
Life isn’t only about school or work; sometimes you just need to get out there, see the world, and open your mind a bit.
I might be broke, but I still managed to save up for some travel.
Honestly, I’m just writing this “travel experience” part to fill in the blank space — and as an excuse to look through old photos and relive those days.

**🏞️ Nanjing County**

The photos from my previous trips are all stored on another phone, and honestly, I’m too lazy to dig them out right now. So I’ll just start by recording the ones I have at the moment.
The first one is from a trip to Nanjing County — if I remember correctly, that was during the summer vacation of my junior year. I was supposed to be preparing for my postgraduate entrance exam, but got persuaded (or tricked) into going on this trip instead.
Nanjing turned out to be a really nice place. It’s just a small county town, but to me, it feels more down-to-earth and full of life than Xiamen. The hot springs there were also pretty great.

**🌃 Shanghai & Hangzhou**

The next trip I took was to Shanghai and Hangzhou, right after finishing the postgraduate entrance exam. The fact that I rushed to travel right after the exam probably says a lot about how poorly I did — I had only studied for about two months anyway (not exactly the attitude of someone determined to pass).
Shanghai is a huge and vibrant city, full of exciting things I’d never seen before. Still, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I didn’t quite belong there.
That being said, the Bund at night was truly impressive — I have to admit, the city really shines after dark.

I stayed in Shanghai for about three days before heading to Hangzhou. I really liked Hangzhou — compared to Shanghai, it felt more peaceful and full of everyday life, even though the food wasn’t exactly impressive. I visited Lingyin Temple and wandered around for a while.

**🌊 Jinjiang**

After coming back from Hangzhou, it was about time to start working on my graduation project. During that period, my friend Dianyang failed one of his exams and had to take a makeup test. Out of pure curiosity — and mostly for fun — I went with him to Fuzhou University’s Jinjiang campus. We also visited the nearby beach, and honestly, it was amazing.

**🗾 Japan**

Finally, there came the last trip before starting work — after graduation. This time, I went straight to Japan. There’s not much to say about it — it was simply a great trip, full of fun.

**🌅 Looking** **Ahead**

And that’s where this journey came to an end. Next came work and a new chapter of life. I hope I’ll be able to keep adding new photos in the future.

<!-- A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured Markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various Markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your Markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over - just be sure to save the Markdown files! You can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

For those users that need more advanced functionality, the template also supports the following popular tools:
- [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) for mathematical equations
- [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) for diagraming
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/javascript/) for plotting

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "Use this template" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](https://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one Markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a Markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each Markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual Markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the Markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and Markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

For more info
------
More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful. -->
